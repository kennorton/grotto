        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The internet is in dire need of a checkpoint. We have all been there, spending countless hours scrolling through social media feeds, 
            desperately searching for that next squirt of dopamine to quench the thirst of our weary souls. 
            Exhausting. There is no shortage of stimulation, no place to rest. 
            There must somewhere, a place of momentary solace, that can provide a much-needed recharge. 
            That is where grotto comes in.

            "grotto" is a going to be an experiment with music and visuals; an interactive art piece, 
            if you will. No online shopping, no social media interactions, just interactive music and visuals. 
            It will function by offering the user a set of colors (or sliders, I don't know yet) to play around with. 
            By interacting with these elements, the music on the page will change, either in pace, pitch, or what instruments are audible. 
            The visuals will also change in some way to match the mood of the music. It’s that simple! (It isn’t. I’m scared of JavaScript.)

        <h2>Potential Applications</h2>
        <p>
            While this site is mostly useless and just a cool, artistic proof-of-concept, 
            I could see some of its elements and tech being used in other projects like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>- A portfolio where each button pressed plays random animal noises (how fun!)</li>
            <li>- A Spotify clone, but better and with fun visuals.</li>
            <li>- An eye-catching, ear-soothing, web store. (Just add store buttons to it. Trust me, it’ll be neat.)</li>
        </ul>
